<h2>My Heroes</h2>
<ul class="heroes">
    <!-- *ngFor lists all of the heroes, it loops through the heroes array and assigns each iteration the value of hero. Similar to a for of loop. The (click) event binding to the li tells angular to listen for a click-->
    <li 
        *ngFor="let hero of heroes"
        (click)="onSelect(hero)"
        [class.selected]="hero === selectedHero"> 
        <!-- Class binding makes it easy to add and remove CSS class conditionally. When the current row hero is the same as the selectedHero, Angular adds the selected CSS class. When the two heroes are different, Angular removces the class. -->
        <span class="badge">{{hero.id}}</span> {{hero.name}}
    </li>
</ul>

<!-- [hero]="selectedHero" is an Angular property binding which helps you set values for properties of HTML elements or directives. Now when the user clicks on a hero list, the selectedHero changes. -->
<app-hero-detail [hero]="selectedHero"></app-hero-detail>
