<!-- To click on a hero and reveal the details, we need a section for the details to render in the template. Initially, the app fails becuase there is no intial selected hero. To fix this, we add an ngIf to hide the empty details if the selectedHero exists. When selectedHero is undefined, the ngIf removes the hero detail from the DOM. There are no selectedHero bindings to consider. When the user picks a hero, selectedHero has a value and ngIf puts the hero detail into the DOM. -->

<div *ngIf="hero">
    <h2>{{hero.name | uppercase}} Details</h2>
    <div><span>id: </span>{{hero.id}}</div>
    <div>
        <label>name: 
            <input [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name">
        </label>
    </div>
</div>

<button (click)="goBack()">go back</button>
<button (click)="save()">save</button>
